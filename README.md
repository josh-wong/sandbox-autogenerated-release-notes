# Sandbox for generating release notes
This repository is for testing how to generate release notes in GitHub. By using this function in GitHub, you can reduce manual work related to writing out release notes. 

_**No more having to remember what is included in a release when writing release notes!ðŸ™Œ**_

Generating release notes can be further customized, for example, by using the [release-drafter / release-drafter](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter) GitHub Action.
